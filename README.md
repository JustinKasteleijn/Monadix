# 🧠 Monadix

**Monadix** is a functional programming library for C# that brings **type classes**, **higher-kinded types**, and core functional abstractions like `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad`, and `Foldable` to the .NET ecosystem.

Inspired by Haskell and Scala, Monadix enables expressive, composable, and pure functional code — using advanced type patterns encoded in modern C#.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Emulated **higher-kinded types** (`Kind<F, A>`) in C#
- ✅ Support for **type classes**: `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad`, `Foldable`, etc.
- ✅ Write **generic, type-safe, functional code**
- ✅ Designed for extensibility — define your own data types and instances
- ✅ Leverages static polymorphism via interfaces and generic constraints

---

## 📖 Documentation

The library is currently under active development, and documentation will be added as features stabilize.

---

## Target Audience 

The software is primarily intended to enhance understanding of functional programming concepts in C#, with a focus on Category Theory principles. 
Usage of the software for any production purposes is not recommended due to its experimental nature.

## 📦 Installation

> 🚧 **Note:** Monadix is a work-in-progress and currently intended for learning, experimentation, or advanced FP-in-C# projects.

```bash
dotnet add package Monadix --version 1.0.0
```

Alternitevly you can clone the repository directly:

```bash
